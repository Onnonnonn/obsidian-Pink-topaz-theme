This is a pink obsidian theme for stimulating happiness. It is designed to create the most compassionate and sweetest environment for reading, thinking  and writing. 

This theme started out as a set of snippets on top of the [Blue Topaz](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-blue-topaz-v2-4-updated-20210403-for-v0-11-12/6425) as soon as I realized  [WhyI](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/whyI)'s Blue Topaz does all the features I was ever trying to do in my DIY snippets and got the job done in a much nicer way. I have worked to collect colours from photos, websites as inspirations to make it more aesthetically appealing. I hope Pink Topaz calms and reassures your emotional energies the way it did to me and my friends.

If you like a more inspiring and neutral theme, check out my [Golden Topaz](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/golden-topaz-theme-of-sublime/18489). :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
